# ascii_roguelike
A roguelike game with ASCII graphics in command prompt. The misspelling "ascci" is intentional, being our title.

We used Java to build this game using console line outputs to generate a map and obstacles.

to run: just compile app.java using javac, and run "app" using java. (sorry no jar or anything)
